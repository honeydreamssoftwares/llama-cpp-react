# LLAMA.cpp Selfhosting Demo

This project, "llama-cpp-react", demonstrates a self-hosting setup for the LLAMA.cpp using React. It uses Vite as the build tool and TypeScript for type safety.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (Preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn (as your package manager)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git [clone https://yourrepository.com/llama-cpp-react.git](https://github.com/honeydreamssoftwares/llama-cpp-react)
cd llama-cpp-react
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or with yarn
yarn install
```

### Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or with yarn
yarn dev
```

This command will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or with yarn
yarn build
```
This command will bundle your application into static files for production.

### Linting

To lint the application for potential errors:

```bash
npm run lint
# or with yarn
yarn lint
```

### Previewing
